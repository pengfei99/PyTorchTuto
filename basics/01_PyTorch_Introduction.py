""" 1. PyTorch Introduction
PyTorch is developed by Facebook AI Research (FAIR). PyTorch is one of the most widely used open-source machine
learning libraries for deep learning applications. It was first introduced in 2016. Since then, PyTorch has been
gaining popularity among researchers and developers, at the expense of TensorFlow.

Machine learning workflows involve
- preparing training data
- creating models
- optimizing model parameters
- saving the trained models.

In this tutorial you will:
- Learn the key concepts used to build machine learning models
- Learn how to build a Computer Vision model
- Build models with the PyTorch API
